# Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition

## 📖 Project Overview
The Smart Attendance System is an automated attendance management solution that uses **face recognition technology** to mark attendance accurately and efficiently.  
The system detects and recognizes faces in real time and records attendance without any manual intervention, reducing proxy attendance and human errors.

This project is designed for educational institutions to simplify and modernize the attendance process.

## 🧠 System Architecture
1. Camera captures live video stream
2. Face detection is performed using OpenCV
3. Face encoding and recognition is done using trained datasets
4. Recognized faces are matched with stored records
5. Attendance is marked automatically with date and time
6. Attendance reports are generated and stored

## 🔄 Workflow
Dataset Collection → Face Encoding → Face Recognition → Attendance Marking → Report Generation

## 📊 Attendance Report Format
- Date
- Time
- Attendance Status (Present/Absent)
